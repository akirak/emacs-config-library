* Miscellaneous Configuration Files for Emacs
This is my =no-littering-etc-directory= of [[https://github.com/emacscollective/no-littering][no-littering]] package. It currently contains my additional snippets. For some reasons, I don't want to put my snippets in [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d][my Emacs configuration repository]], and I don't like the fact that no-littering automatically creates directories inside the repository, so I created a separate repository.
** Installation
Clone this repository to somewhere:

#+begin_src shell
mkdir -p ~/lib
git clone https://github.com/akirak/emacs-config-library.git ~/lib/emacs
#+end_src

Set =no-littering-etc-directory= before =no-littering= package is loaded:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq no-littering-etc-directory "~/lib/emacs")
  (use-package no-littering)
#+end_src
